hey Caroline. so yeah i can see why maybe you were confused the way an post request error comes up in the console when authenticating with magic link. the same happens me but its funny the login still works it just tries a few times until eventually the post api request to magic (fotmatic) works. you can check this by consoling the "account" to the screen and before authentication it will display null because its undefined but after login it will display your magic wallet address.

i have attached screenshots of what the screen should display from my setup in this repo. let me know if u have any issues
